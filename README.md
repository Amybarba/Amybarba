<p aling="center"> You have landed on Amy Barba's Github account. Currently I am located in Southern California but I am open to relocation for projects.
Upon scanning my repositories you can see the progressive build of code in various areas as well as my collaboration on various project 
based repositories to create applications. In adding marketable skills to my resume I am currently exploring the world of computer code 
via Lambda's Full stack Web Development course and Free Code Camp in order to learn and utilize various code languages; HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript, React, Node,Python and Java. These are just a few and a good base to continue exploring this dynamic field. 
Most of my work with computer coding has been remote and in general collaborative. My previous career I owned and managed a business 
with up to forty employees that were payroll and independent contractors, this allowed me to create a peaceful and communicative team 
environment. 
As an owner of a business and in the world of code I am also comfortable in learning and perservering in self directed education in 
all areas of technology; hardware, data collection, front end design, etc...
I am currently employed in a school district, running a young coders club, and working toward endorsement with Lambda and continued 
certificates with Free Code Camp.
